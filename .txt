two-way data binding

Single-File-Component(SFC)

Vue components can be authored in two different API styles: Options API and Composition API.

Options API
such as data, methods, and mounted.
export default {
  // Properties returned from data() become reactive state
  // and will be exposed on `this`.
  data() {
    return {
      count: 0
    }
  },
}

Composition API
used with <script setup>

 In fact, the Options API is implemented on top of the Composition API! 

 Go with Composition API + Single-File Components if you plan to build full applications with Vue
